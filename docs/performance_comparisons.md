# Library Comparisons

> **Note**: This comparison is not intended to show any library as superior or to discredit others. Itâ€™s purely for analytical purposes based on performance metrics and size comparisons.

The testing involved creating the same forms using popular libraries. All files used for testing are available in the
<a href="https://github.com/shahin-m-hashim/react-hybrid-form/tree/master/examples/Javascript/src/comparisons" target="_blank">comparisons</a> folder of the repository.
